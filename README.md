üåê Running as an API (Optional)

1. Start the Flask server:

python3 scraper_api.py

2. Make a POST request to:

http://localhost:5000/scrape

With body:

{
  "location": "Whitefield Bangalore"
}

Example with curl:

curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/scrape \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"location": "Whitefield Bangalore"}'

üìç Location Slugs

The file location_slugs.py contains a mapping of readable location names to Housing.com URL slugs. For example:

slug_map = {
  "Whitefield Bangalore": "whitefield-psouth-bangalore",
  "JP Nagar Bangalore": "jp-nagar-psouth-bangalore",
  ...
}

If a location is not in the map, the script returns an "Unsupported location" error.
